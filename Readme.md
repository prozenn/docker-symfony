# Docker for Symfony

This is a docker boilerplate for my projects in symfony.

It's composed by:

- `db` - MySQL 8.0
- `php` - PHP 7.4 with Xdebug
- `nginx` - nginx 1.17
- `redis` - latest, alpine version
- `rabbitmq` - RabbitMQ 3.8 with management plugin

This boilerplate is based on [ger86/symfony-docker](https://github.com/ger86/symfony-docker)
